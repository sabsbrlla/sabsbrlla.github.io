She came from a small town, but moved away and allowed herself to grow—she never gave up on her dreams and was able to achieve them. The story takes place after her father’s funeral, and we begin to learn more about her past and how she feels about it. She is met with very complicated feelings for a guy named Ryle that she met in Boston. As Lily begins to feel more and more for this guy, she also thinks back to her first love Atlas Corrigan and the impact he had on her life.
